<h3>A brief biography of me</h3>
<p>I'm Charles Zulu Yonmah, born and raise in Liberia unto the union of Mr. Lawson G. Yonmah and Mrs. Hawa B. Barpaye. I'm from a medium size family that conprised of 9 seblings. I was raised and trained by my poor grand mom and mother from birth up until 15 years prior to moving on to stay with my father.
<h3>Education background</h3>
<p>At age 6, I began my primary education at the pristigious Wilson Daycare school located along the Japan freeway, precisely Gardnersville-Super market. At Wilson Daycare, I genuinely obtained a solid childhood education which solidily shifted me academicly to well transition to the secondary stage of my education. Through this transitional process, I landed at the St. Phillip Economical high school and in no time got grounded and rooted within the system due to the good learning atmosphere and warm reception received from the Administration, the teachers, do to my school mates. After a successful long spell at St. Phillip I took a transfer at the J.C. Goodridge Memorial Foundation School due to magrational reasons. My academy journy at Goodridge was remarkable, resourceful, and rewarding. I began my studies at Goodridge from grade 5 up until my graduation from Secondary school. While at J.C. Goodridge, I served in many capacity ranging from class secretary to president and later emerge as the student counciil president due to the many advocacies and good relationship built over the years with the student populace, and we served with distinction.
